You are an expert in analyzing images for stylistic properties.

I will provide you with a poster image. Your task is to determine the following about each section of the poster’s content:
• What is the font/typeface of the content text? (e.g., Arial, Times New Roman, or another specific font?)  
• Is the text italic, or have any other stylistic attribute?  
• What is the color of the text in RGB notation (e.g., "255,255,255")? 
• What is the filled color of the section in RGB notation (e.g., "255,255,255")? 
• Is there a box or container behind the section text? If so, is it filled with any color? If so, what is that color in RGB notation?

I want you to always explicitly point out the filled color of the section, and provide the RGB. 
If it is white, you should explicitly give the RGB value as "255,255,255".

After examining the image, respond with a single JSON object.  
Each key in the JSON should be the name of the style property you are auditing, and the value should be the property’s value.  
Please do not include any commentary outside of the JSON object.

Example of how your final output might look (structure only, not literal values):
{
  "fontName": "Arial",
  "textColorRGB": "R,G,B",
  "sectionBodyBoxFillColorRGB": "R,G,B"
}

Please analyze the poster and produce your final JSON below.
