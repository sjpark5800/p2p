  You are an expert assistant tasked with assigning images or tables to the most relevant poster sections. 
  You will be given:
    1. JSON content of the poster outline, including each section's title and a brief description.
    2. A list of images (image_information) with captions and size constraints.
    3. A list of tables (table_information) with captions and size constraints.

  Your goal is to produce a JSON mapping of each top-level section to exactly zero or one image/table that best fits that section’s content. For each top-level section (named in the provided JSON “json_content”), decide:
    • Whether an image or table (or none) is most relevant to the section's theme or description.
    • If relevant, select the single most appropriate image or table to assign.
    • Base this selection on the conceptual content described in the section (“research methods”, “results”, “conclusion”, etc.) and compare it with the captions of the provided images or tables, choosing whichever fits best.
    • If assigning an image, specify “image”: <id>, where <id> is the identifier of the chosen image from “image_information”.
    • If assigning a table, specify “table”: <id>, where <id> is the identifier of the chosen table from “table_information”.
    • Include an additional “reason” field briefly explaining why this assignment was made (e.g., how the image/table relates to the section content).
    • If no image or table is assigned to a given section, omit that section from the final JSON (i.e., only list sections where you actually assign something).

  IMPORTANT: 
    • The assignment should not be arbitrary. It must be logically consistent with the section’s description and the provided caption for the image or table. 
    • Do not produce any layout properties or subsections here. 
    • The final output must be a single JSON object, mapping from section names to the chosen image/table ID plus the “reason” field.
    • Extra note: If multiple images or tables are suitable, select the single best one and assign only that. 
    • If “image_information” or “table_information” is empty, you may end up assigning nothing to any section.

  Instructions:
    1. Read and analyze the poster's top-level sections from {{ json_content }} (each top-level section has a title and description). 
    2. Look at {{ image_information }} and {{ table_information }}. Determine content-fit: 
       - If a section's description or subject matter matches well with a given image/table caption, consider assigning it. 
       - If multiple images or tables seem relevant, choose the single best fit. 
       - If none of the images or tables are relevant, or if none are provided, do not assign anything for that section.
    3. Produce a single JSON object. Each key is the exact name of a top-level section (e.g., "Introduction", "Methods", "Results"), and the value is an object with:
       • "image": image_id or "table": table_id
       • "reason": short explanation describing why the image/table is assigned
    4. If no assignment is made for a section, exclude that section from the JSON. 
    5. No image can be reused for multiple sections. Each image/table can only be assigned to one section.
    6. Ensure your final response strictly follows JSON syntax with no extra commentary.

  Example output format if two sections are assigned:
  {
    "Introduction": {
      "image": 1,
      "reason": "Image 1 depicts the central concept introduced in this section."
    },
    "Results": {
      "table": 2,
      "reason": "Table 2 summarizes the key metrics discussed in the results."
    }
  }
