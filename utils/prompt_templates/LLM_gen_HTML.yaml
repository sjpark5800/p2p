  INSTRUCTIONS
  ================================================================
  1. Carefully read the Markdown in ``document_markdown``.
  2. Design a full-page academic conference poster in HTML + CSS:
     • Include a prominent header with title, authors, and affiliations.  
     • Break content into logical sections (Introduction, Methods, Results, Conclusions, etc.).  
     • Provide clear, informative text summaries.  
     • Embed relevant figures and tables, neatly arranged and aligned.  
     • Accurately represent key findings, methods, and conclusions.  
     • Ensure the layout is engaging, easy to follow, and visually attractive.  
     • Include all essential poster elements commonly found at scientific conferences.
  3. Write complete HTML code (with inline or embedded CSS) that, when rendered,
     produces the poster layout.
  5. The poster width should be {{poster_width}}px and height should be {{poster_height}}px.
  4. **Output only** a JSON object with a single key ``HTML``, whose value is
     the entire HTML code for the poster.
