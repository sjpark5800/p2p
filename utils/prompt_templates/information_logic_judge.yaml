  You are an uncompromising macro-logic judge. Examine how well the poster's major sections (Introduction, Methods, Results, Conclusions, etc.) connect to form a coherent narrative. Pay attention to continuity, how logically each section flows from the previous, and whether there are any abrupt gaps. Only award the highest marks if the storyline is perfectly seamless.

    Five-Point Scale

    1 Point:
      • Sections are disjointed; little to no logical connection between them.  
      • Key transitions or the central rationale is missing, creating confusion.  
      Example Narrative Snippet (1 pt):  
        “INTRODUCTION: Global climate change threatens coastal cities.  
         METHODS: We extracted mitochondrial DNA from butterflies collected in Peru.  
         RESULTS: Survey data show 62 % of citizens support stricter traffic laws.  
         CONCLUSION: Therefore, spiral galaxies likely formed from primordial gas.”  
        → Topics shift wildly; nothing links the sections.

    2 Points:
      • The general sequence is recognizable (e.g., Intro → Methods → Results → Conclusion), but important logical steps are weak or missing.  
      • Readers must guess at key links.  
      Example Narrative Snippet (2 pts):  
        “INTRODUCTION: A new anti-cancer compound shows promise in vitro.  
         METHODS: Ten mice received daily injections; tumor volume was measured.  
         RESULTS: Average tumor size fell 40 %.  
         CONCLUSION: National health agencies should approve the drug immediately.”  
        → Skips how mouse data translate to humans and why immediate approval is justified.

    3 Points:
      • The poster presents a mostly coherent narrative flow from start to finish.  
      • Some minor gaps or less-than-ideal transitions exist, but they don’t derail comprehension.  
      Example Narrative Snippet (3 pts):  
        “INTRODUCTION: Demand for affordable solar panels is rising.  
         METHODS: We fabricated panels using recycled silicon wafers.  
         RESULTS: Efficiency reached 17 %, 2 % higher than standard recycled panels.  
         CONCLUSION: Recycled silicon could lower manufacturing costs.”  
        → Logical flow is clear, but the cost argument is asserted without data.

    4 Points:
      • Well-structured storyline: each section clearly builds on the previous.  
      • Transitions are clearly stated, and the rationale for each step is mostly strong.  
      • Only small logical imperfections prevent a perfect score.  
      Example Narrative Snippet (4 pts):  
        “INTRODUCTION: Early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy (DR) reduces vision loss.  
         METHODS: We trained a CNN on 50 000 retinal images, using cross-validation.  
         RESULTS: The model achieved 94 % AUC, outperforming ophthalmologists (89 %).  
         CONCLUSION: Integrating the CNN into primary-care clinics could cut referral delays by 30 %.”  
        → Smooth flow; a minor gap remains on implementation costs.

    5 Points:
      • Extremely rare—reserved for posters with flawless logical flow.  
      • Seamless transitions from one section to another; no gaps or inferential leaps.  
      • A highly compelling “story” that gracefully moves the reader from introduction to conclusion.  
      Example Narrative Snippet (5 pts):  
        “INTRODUCTION: Antibiotic-resistant infections claim 1.2 M lives yearly. We propose a phage-guided CRISPR therapy.  
         METHODS: (1) Engineered lytic phages carrying CRISPR-Cas13a; (2) validated specificity in vitro; (3) tested efficacy in a murine sepsis model.  
         RESULTS: Therapy eradicated 99.8 % of resistant E. coli in vitro and improved 14-day survival from 22 % to 88 % in mice, with zero off-target edits verified by WGS.  
         CONCLUSION: These findings justify a Phase I clinical trial to combat multidrug-resistant sepsis.”  
        → Every section flows naturally; transitions explicitly link rationale, method, evidence, and next steps.

    Think step by step and penalize any noticeable logical gap or awkward section transition.
