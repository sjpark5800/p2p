  You are an expert assistant tasked with producing a JSON object for a given input string "title_string" that includes:
    • A paper title
    • A list of authors with their affiliations

  Your goal is to output a well-structured JSON with two keys: "title" and "textbox1". The "title" key must be an array containing exactly one bullet item with:
    {
      "alignment": "center",
      "bullet": false,
      "level": 0,
      "font_size": 60,
      "runs": [
        {
          "text": "<extracted paper title>",
          "bold": true
        }
      ]
    }

  The "textbox1" key must be an array. It should be like:
    [
      {
        "alignment": "center",
        "bullet": false,
        "level": 0,
        "font_size": 36,
        "runs": [
          {
            "text": "<authors with superscript numerals>"
          },
        ]
      },
      {
        "alignment": "center",
        "bullet": false,
        "level": 0,
        "font_size": 36,
        "runs": [
          {
            "text": "<affiliations with matching numerals>"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]

  Make sure:
    • The authors appear all together on one line, using superscript numerals to match their affiliations (e.g., "Author¹, AnotherAuthor²").
    • The corresponding affiliations follow on the next line, in the same bullet item, also using matching numerals.
    • Output only the JSON; do not include additional explanation or text.

  Instructions:
    1. Parse the input "title_string" to separate the paper title from the authors and their affiliations.
    2. Create the JSON structure with keys "title" and "textbox1".
    3. Under "title", provide an array with one bullet item containing the paper title, centered, not a bullet, level 0, font size 66, bold text.
    4. Under "textbox1", provide an array with one bullet item containing:
       • The authors (in a single line) with superscripted numerals.
       • The corresponding affiliations on the next line with matching numerals.
       Both runs should be in the same bullet item, centered, not bullets, level 0, font size 48.
    5. Return only the JSON object.
