Scoring Criteria (Five-Point Scale):

1 Point (Poor):
The text on the slides contains significant grammatical errors or is poorly structured, making it difficult to understand.

2 Points (Below Average):
The slides lack a clear focus, the text is awkwardly phrased, and the overall organization is weak, making it hard to engage the audience.

3 Points (Average):
The slide content is clear and complete but lacks visual aids, resulting in insufficient overall appeal.

4 Points (Good):
The slide content is clear and well-developed, but the images have weak relevance to the theme, limiting the effectiveness of the presentation.

5 Points (Excellent):
The slides are well-developed with a clear focus, and the images and text effectively complement each other to convey the information successfully.
