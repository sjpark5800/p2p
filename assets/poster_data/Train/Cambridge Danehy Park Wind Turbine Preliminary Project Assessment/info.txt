		<Text>Wind Resource Assessment</Text>
		<Text>We collected wind speed data at the site over seven months using</Text>
		<Text>sensors mounted to a light pole at two different heights. We then</Text>
		<Text>correlated the data with historical data collected at Logan airport</Text>
		<Text>from 1997 to 2010 to estimate the long‐term wind resource</Text>
		<Text>available at Danehy Park. The method used to perform the</Text>
		<Text>estimation is the binned linear regression Measure‐Correlate‐</Text>
		<Text>Predict (MCP). Please see our written report for additional details.</Text>
		<Figure left="36" right="1212" width="799" height="325" no="2" OriWidth="0" OriHeight="0
" />
		<Text>From these estimated wind speeds, we used an approximate wind</Text>
		<Text>shear scaling formula to compute a synthetic hourly wind speed</Text>
		<Text>time series at hub height for each of the turbines in our evaluation</Text>
		<Text>set. From these time series and the turbines’ power curves, we</Text>
		<Text>computed estimated annual energy production for each turbine.</Text>

		<Text>Financial Analysis</Text>
		<Text>Using approximate values for purchase, installation, electricity</Text>
		<Text>generation, insurance, and maintenance, we computed net present</Text>
		<Text>values (NPVs) for each of the turbines in our evaluation set. These</Text>
		<Text>figures are very rough, as there were many details left out, notably</Text>
		<Text>the effects of clean energy incentives and potential complications</Text>
		<Text>arising from the site being built on capped landfill.</Text>

		<Text>The above turbines were chosen to provide broad representative</Text>
		<Text>coverage of current small to medium scale turbines that would likely</Text>
		<Text>be considered for installation at this site. Larger turbines would</Text>
		<Text>have to contend with increasingly burdensome noise and shadow</Text>
		<Text>flicker issues, greater financial risk, as well as the potential for</Text>
		<Text>greater community resistance.</Text>

		<Text>Environmental Impact</Text>
		<Text>Danehy Park is located within a mile of Fresh Pond, a large body of</Text>
		<Text>water located in West Cambridge. Mass Audubon has indicated that</Text>
		<Text>birds concentrate in the area in significant numbers in breeding</Text>
		<Text>season, winter, and during migration.</Text>
		<Text>Of the many bird species</Text>
		<Text>observed living near or migrating</Text>
		<Text>through the Fresh Pond area, the</Text>
		<Text>few that are listed as endangered</Text>
		<Text>or of special concern by the state</Text>
		<Text>are infrequently observed in the</Text>
		<Text>area. Also, several recent studies</Text>
		<Text>examining birds and wind</Text>
		<Text>turbines have observed that</Text>
		<Text>most birds usually avoid turbine</Text>
		<Text>blades. Please see our written</Text>
		<Text>report for additional details.</Text>

		<Text>Community Impact</Text>
		<Text>The size of the area in which shadow flicker from spinning blades is</Text>
		<Text>detectable by the human eye varies with turbine height and rotor</Text>
		<Text>diameter. The map below shows the potential areas of effect for</Text>
		<Text>the Polaris 20 (blue) and Northern Power 100 (yellow) in various</Text>
		<Text>locations. The area of shadow flicker effect for the Aeronautica 29‐</Text>
		<Text>225 and Polaris 500 overlapped with neighboring residential areas.</Text>

		<Text>Another community impact issue associated with wind turbine</Text>
		<Text>development is noise level. Each turbine has a noise (sound</Text>
		<Text>pressure) level that decreases as a function of distance from the</Text>
		<Text>turbine, as shown in the above graph.</Text>
		<Text>The noise level from a turbine decreases by approximately half (6</Text>
		<Text>dB) for every doubling in distance from the turbine. The markers in</Text>
		<Text>the graph above indicate the manufacturer‐published noise levels.</Text>
		<Text>For reference, 55 dBA corresponds to the noise level of a busy</Text>
		<Text>office. The diameter of the yellow shaded area in the map is</Text>
		<Text>roughly 400 meters.</Text>
