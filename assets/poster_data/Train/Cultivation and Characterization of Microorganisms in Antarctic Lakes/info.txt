		<Text>INTRODUCTION</Text>
		<Text>Antarctic Lakes harbor pristine biotopes and include freshwater and saline systems that are subject to long</Text>
		<Text>periods of ice and snow-cover, low temperatures and low levels of photosynthetically active radiation.</Text>
		<Text>Unfortunately, the recovery of cultivable organisms from Antarctica is very difficult, and the development of new</Text>
		<Text>methods to resuscitation and cultivability of Antarctic microorganisms is very important. In order to understand</Text>
		<Text>the diversity, survival, and activity of microorganisms in Antarctic zone, we cultivated and characterized</Text>
		<Text>bacterial isolates from Antarctic lakes.</Text>

		<Text>RESULT AND DISCUSSION</Text>
		<Text>The results of the homology analysis of 16s rRNA gene sequences showed that the isolates represented a</Text>
		<Text>wide diversity of both gram-positive and gram-negative heterotrophic bacteria belonging to five major classes:</Text>
		<Text>Gamma-proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Alpha-proteobacteria, Bacilli, Flavobacteria class. Isolates related to</Text>
		<Text>Flavobacteria formed the largest cluster in terms of diversity, with 9 pylogenetically distinct organisms.</Text>

		<Text>CONCLUSION</Text>
		<Text>1. While there were only two strains isolated from</Text>
		<Text>incubation at 20ºC by spreading the Antarctica lake samples</Text>
		<Text>directly onto agar-media plates, twenty strains were isolated</Text>
		<Text>at 4ºC by filtration Antarctica lake samples. It was thought</Text>
		<Text>that microorganisms in Antarctica lakes had been subjected</Text>
		<Text>to low temperature and limiting nutrient for long time, and</Text>
		<Text>high incubation temperature and rich nutrient medium might</Text>
		<Text>be stressor for Antarctic microorganisms. Therefore,</Text>
		<Text>incubation at low temperature with media not containing</Text>
		<Text>rich nutrition were more suitable for Antarctica lake</Text>
		<Text>microorganisms because the isolated microorganisms were</Text>
		<Text>likely to be adapted to the oligotrophic conditions of many</Text>
		<Text>cold habitats.</Text>
		<Text>2. 16S rDNA sequencing results suggested that three of the</Text>
		<Text>isolates might represent new species. Strain No. 15, 41, and</Text>
		<Text>27 (28, 32, and 44) showed 93%, 97%, and 97% similarity</Text>
		<Text>with the GenBank database respectively. Strain No. 15, 41,</Text>
		<Text>and 27 (28, 32, and 44) are likely novel species in the genus</Text>
		<Text>Gillisia, Psychroflexus, and Flavobacterium which belong to</Text>
		<Text>the Flavobacteria group.</Text>
