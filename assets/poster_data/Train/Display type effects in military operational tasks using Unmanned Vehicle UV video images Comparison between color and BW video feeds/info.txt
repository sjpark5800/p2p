		<Text>Background:The use of UV imagery in combat</Text>
		<Text>has become essential for mission success. Factors that</Text>
		<Text>may affect the UV video feeds’ utilization are color and</Text>
		<Text>quality of the feed. Specifically, the use of black and white</Text>
		<Text>feeds or colored ones is considered both from technical</Text>
		<Text>aspects and cognitive aspects. Operationally, B/W is often</Text>
		<Text>used due to band width limitations, or payload selection.</Text>
		<Text>Previously (Oron-Gilad, Redden & Minkov, 2011) we have</Text>
		<Text>shown task dependent differences among display types</Text>
		<Text>with regard to soldiers’ performances on intelligence</Text>
		<Text>gathering type tasks.</Text>

		<Text>Method:16 former infantry soldiers with MOUT</Text>
		<Text>experience but no prior experience using UV video feed</Text>

		<Text>task types (orientation, identification and response to a</Text>
		<Text>movement), all using simulated UAV and UGV video</Text>

		<Text>Discussion:Results showed superiority for the</Text>
		<Text>UGV feed. Although consistent with our previous study, in</Text>
		<Text>operational contexts generally, aerial vertical views are</Text>
		<Text>considered more informative and easy to understand than</Text>
		<Text>ground horizontal ones, due to their holistic view and</Text>
		<Text>similarity to aerial maps.</Text>
		<Text>The experimental scenarios may have contributed to the</Text>
		<Text>superiority of the UGV. If the task can be conducted from</Text>
		<Text>both ground and aerial perspective feeds then it is</Text>
		<Text>reasonable to assume that the ground view (which is more</Text>
		<Text>compatible with the soldier's point of view) will be preferred.</Text>
		<Text>• Nevertheless, one should keep in mind that oftentimes in</Text>
		<Text>operational settings the UGV is not capable of viewing the</Text>
		<Text>same information as the UAV and the two sources provide</Text>
		<Text>complementary feed (see Ophir-Arbelle, Oron-Gilad,</Text>

		<Text>Conclusions and future work:</Text>
		<Text>Evidence had shown that for video and map based</Text>
		<Text>missions a larger display has its superiority, and that B/W</Text>
		<Text>feeds may be good enough to perform certain tasks in</Text>
		<Text>larger displays. Experimental design considerations may</Text>
		<Text>have influenced the results, e.g., the simulation conditions,</Text>
		<Text>the (high) quality of the simulated feeds, the lack of role for</Text>
		<Text>color in the operational tasks and scenarios, and the</Text>
		<Text>partial-balance of the experimental design. Amongst other</Text>
		<Text>factors, future studies should focus on how the cognitive</Text>
		<Text>state of the operator e.g., mental or physical fatigue and</Text>
		<Text>extreme stress affect performance.</Text>
