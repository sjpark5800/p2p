		<Text>A & B) Scene classification accuracy over 6-, 8- and 15-CAT datasets. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean over 10 runs. Naive</Text>
		<Text>chance is simply set by the size of the largest class. All models work well above chance level. C) Top: animal vs. non-animal (distractor images)</Text>
		<Text>classification. Bottom: classification of target images. 4-way classification is only over target scenes (and not distractors).</Text>
		<Text>- A & B: We find that HOG, SSIM, texton, denseSIFT, LBP,</Text>
		<Text>and LBHPF outperform other models (accuracy above 70%).</Text>
		<Text>We note that spatial feature integration (i.e., x_pyr for the</Text>
		<Text>model x) enhances accuracies.</Text>
		<Text>- C: Animal vs. Non-Animal: All models perform above 70%,</Text>
		<Text>except tiny image. Human accuracy here is about 80%. Inter-</Text>
		<Text>estingly, some models exceed human performance here.</Text>
		<Text>SUN dataset: Models that performed well on small datasets</Text>
		<Text>(although they degrade heavily) still rank on top. GIST model</Text>
		<Text>works well here (16.3%) but below top contenders: HOG, tex-</Text>
		<Text>ton, SSIM, denseSIFT, and LBP (or their variants). Models</Text>
		<Text>ranking at the bottom, in order, are tiny image, line hist, geo</Text>

		<Text>Learned Lessons</Text>
		<Text>1) Models outperform humans in rapid categorization tasks, indicating that discriminative informa-</Text>
		<Text>tion is in place but humans do not have enough time to extract it. Models outperform humans on</Text>
		<Text>jumbled images and score relatively high in absence of (less) global information.</Text>
		<Text>2) We find that some models and edge detection methods are more efficient on line drawings and</Text>
		<Text>edge maps. Our analysis helps objectively assess the power of edge detection algorithms to ex-</Text>
		<Text>tract meaningful structural features for classification, which hints toward new directions.</Text>
		<Text>3) While models are far from human performance over object and scene recognition on natural</Text>
		<Text>scenes, even classic models show high performance and correlation with humans on sketches.</Text>
		<Text>4) Consistent with the literature, we find that some models (e.g., HOG, SSIM, geo/texton, and</Text>
		<Text>GIST) perform well. We find that they also resemble Fighumans better.</Text>
		<Text>5) Invariance analysis shows that only sparseSIFT and geo_color are invariant to in-plane rotation</Text>
		<Text>with the former having higher accuracy (our 3rd test). GIST, a model of scene recognition works</Text>
		<Text>better than many models over both Caltech-256 and Sketch datasets.</Text>
